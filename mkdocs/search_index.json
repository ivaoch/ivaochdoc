This is called the extended label, and corresponds to the right label in this documentation.\n\n\nLabel definition Switzerland\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere is a lot to cover in this part, as IVAC2 offers the possibility to customize the labels until the smallest detail. That's why this part of the documentation is particularly important, so make sure you read it carefully.\n\n\nIn Switzerland we created our labels in order to match the real ones used by Skyguide. There are some small differences, as we had to adapt some functions for IVAO.\n\n\nWhat has been customized ?\n\n\nFirst of all, the symbols of the track are different depending on different situations (VFR, IFR, concerned, and so on).\n\n\nThen, you have to know that we have 2 label formats in Switzerland. \n\n\nOne is for Enroute Control, the other for Arrival/Departure Control. \nThe Ground labels are common for both definitions, they are composed of following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround Default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround Departure traffic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround Arrival traffic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Airborne labels are composed of following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirborne psr (sqwk SBY)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirborne default (default airborne label)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirborne concerned (label when your sector has been set NEXT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirborne assumed (assumed label)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirborne filtered (label when filter is active)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirborne released (released label)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will cover all of them in this document, as the labels we have in IVAC2 have nothing to do with the ones of IVAC1.\n\n\nSymbols\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe symbols are the easiest part, as there are only 3 different symbols.\n\n\n used for VFR traffic or psr traffic (transponder off or on sby)\n\n\n used for IFR flights\n\n\n used for concerned traffic.
