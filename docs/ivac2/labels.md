##Labels

First of all, you have to know that we have 2 label definitions in Switzerland. 
One is for ACC Control, the other for Arrival/Departure Control. 
The Ground labels are common for both definitions, they are composed of following categories:

-	Ground Default

-	Ground Departure traffic

-	Ground Arrival traffic

-	Ground Vehicle

The Airborne labels are composed of following categories:

-	Airborne psr (sqwk SBY)

-	Airborne default (default airborne label)

-	Airborne concerned (label when your sector has been set NEXT)

-	Airborne assumed (assumed label)

-	Airborne filtered (label when filter is active)

-	Airborne released (released label)


We will cover all of them in this document, as the labels we have in IVAC2 have nothing to do with the ones of IVAC1.

General knowledge about labels
Extended label: You will notice quite fast that you have more or less information on a label depending if you hover your mouse on it or not. This is called the extended label.
