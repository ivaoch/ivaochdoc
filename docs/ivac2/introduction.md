<p style="text-align:justify">
Welcome to the documentation pages about the FIR Definition of Switzerland.
You will learn how our definition works, and how you can use it to open a position. 

In each case this document <b>IS NOT</b> the documentation about the Software IvAc v2, but <b>ONLY</b> the documentation for the <u>FIR Definition Switzerland</u>.

Then, the FIR Definition of Switzerland is completed at a level you can open a position without any problems, but there will always be improvements or updates. 

If you have any suggestions, problems or anything to share about the FIR Definition, please post on the corresponding topic in the Forum of IVAO Switzerland.

And finally, we just wanted to remind you that it is not possible to change the colors, the files or the FIR Definition by yourself as you could do it with IvAc 1. IvAc v2 uses a centralized database with the FIR Definitions, and each time you launch IvAc v2 it will check if there is a new version online.
