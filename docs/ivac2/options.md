On this page, you will find some usefull options we recommend you to use when controlling in Switzerland. They are not mandatory, but recommended.

##NEXT FREQ

In IVAC2, you have to enter a "next" position in the label in order to perform a transfer to the next controller. 

Once you entered the "next" position, the label is indicating the position name by default, like this:

We recommend you to activate the NEXT FREQ option, which you can find into DISPLAY > NEXT FREQ.

<u>What will it change ? </u>

Instead of seeing the name, you will see the frequency of it. This is very usefull as you won't have to check the frequency each time in the ATC box, and thus transfer the traffic in a more efficient way.
This is how it looks like:

<b>Of course the same applies to the ground labels.</b>

##BRT

The maps are not customizable, but you can still changes its brightness by using the BRT option.

Once open, you will be able to change the brightness of different maps using the sliders. Don't hesitate to use it, as it may be usefull when having different lighting conditions in your room.
